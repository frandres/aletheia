\begin{abstract}
There is an increasing interest in having tools to closely monitor the activity of politicians for transparency and accountability purposes. Among the different approaches in the literature, using Social Network Analysis tools for studying the dynamics of power inside a Parliament has yielded interesting results. However, finding collaborations between politicians and third party actors, which often do not appear in bills or in the transcripts of debates, remains a challenge. In this work we present a novel technique for automatically generating social networks relating politicians and other relevant third party actors that can be used for political analysis. Our proposal uses parliamentary data and news articles for automatically detecting relevant entities and discovering their relations by looking at their semantic similarity and co-occurrence in documents. We i) use bills approved by a parliament to model topics, ii) use these topics to find related news articles, iii) perform entity extraction and filtering and iv) compute and threshold entity-entity similarity measures to generate social networks describing the dynamics surrounding a bill. We apply our tool to analyze bills from the Catalan Parliament and show how relevant insights indicating patterns of collaboration between political actors can be gained.
