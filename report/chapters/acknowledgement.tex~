\section{Acknowledgement}

The path that has brought me here has been long and full of hurdles.
I would like to thank everyone that supported me and made
this trip worth it, specially those with which I spent
long periods of time in classrooms or laboratories; it
has really been an exciting experience to meet all of you,
and learn from you.\\

I would like to give special thanks to my advisors, who guided
me with a lot of patience through this process, I really appreciate it.\\

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their everlasting support,
and my beloved sidekick, who never left my side during this journey.
